childcare
=========

An app created for the HRM app contest.  Uses one of the trial data sets that the government has exposed to help users find the nearest childcare provider.

Using it is simple.  When you land on the site it finds the 10 daycare providers nearest you and displays them on the map.  You can then refine your search using the search form.  It allows you to change the age of your child or the type of provider that you need.
